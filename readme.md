# School Schedule
Unofficial KronoX app for Android and iOS made using Flutter

## Supported Platforms
The app is available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crow.school_schedule).
It is not available on the App Store as I don't have a license for it, but iOS is still a supported platform if you want to build it yourself.

## State of the Project
The project is current in a kind of maintenance only state, as I'll try to keep it updated for newer versions
of Android, Flutter etc., but new features are unlikely to be added. This is mainly due to the fact that
I currently do not study at any university, and therefore does not actively use the app anymore.
This means I can not actively make sure the app works, so if there are any issues, please open up
an issue, or get in contact with me some other way, to let me know.
You are also very welcome to open a pull request if you want to fix any issues yourself.
