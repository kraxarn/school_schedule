Unofficial KronoX app for Android and iOS, because you deserve better

## State of the Project
The app is currently in very early stages. The app will soon reach beta stage with support for viewing your schedule and be available on Google Play, as I currently do not have an iOS developer license, it will not be available there until the app replaces the official KronoX app.

The rest of the functionality of the KronoX app, like resource booking, will not be available until documentation about the KronoX system is shared by the KronoX developers, which is requested, or it is reverse engineered. Receiving the documentation and hopefully replacing the current application is preferred.
