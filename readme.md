# school_schedule
Unofficial KronoX app for Android and iOS made using Flutter

## State of the Project
The app is currently in a mostly working state, with schedule viewing and resource booking working as expected. The app is available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crow.school_schedule). It is not available on the App Store as I don't have a license for it.

Some schools may not work as expected (please let me know) and exam booking is currently not available as I don't have the resources to test it. It will not be available until documentation about the KronoX system is shared by the KronoX developers, which is requested, or it is reverse engineered. Receiving the documentation and hopefully replacing the current application is preferred.
